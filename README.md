**The Notes App**
*Overview*
The Notes App is a simple yet efficient Android application built to help users manage their notes. The app allows users to create, update, and delete notes, while also offering a categorization feature for better organization. This app is built using modern Android development practices like MVVM architecture, Room database for local storage, and LiveData for reactive UI updates.

*Key Features*
Create Notes: Add new notes with ease using a simple and user-friendly interface.
Edit Notes: Update existing notes at any time.
Delete Notes: Remove notes that are no longer needed.
Categorize Notes: Organize notes into different categories for easier access.
Persistent Storage: All notes are stored locally using the Room database, ensuring data remains even after the app is closed.

*Tech Stack & Tools*
Programming Language: Kotlin
Architecture: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
Local Storage: Room Database
UI/UX: Material Design principles
Reactive Programming: LiveData and ViewModel
Dependency Injection: Dagger/Hilt (if used)
Build Tool: Gradle (Kotlin DSL)
